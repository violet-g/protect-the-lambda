1) Functionality:
 - move and capture functionalities have been implemented and tested in the command line,
   code is split into small functions and is documented
 - load is implemented and works as expected when a file is given but does not have error checking
 - save command has not been implemented

2) Testing
 I was working on a lab machine and was running the tests by following the commands given but I got odd behaviour:
 I did not get any output from my programme and all tests output fail because of this issue. That is why I did
 functionality testing by exhausting combinations
